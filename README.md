# Exploring the Car Manufacturing Process

This project is aimed at creating an interactive visualization of the car manufacturing process. It includes a timeline-mindmap interface that allows users to navigate through different phases of the manufacturing process and view details for each phase.

## Features

- **Interactive Timeline-Mindmap**: Phases of the car manufacturing process are represented as nodes in a mindmap-like structure.
- **Node Navigation**: Users can navigate through different phases by interacting with the nodes.
- **Phase Details**: Details for each phase are displayed when users hover over the corresponding segment of the timeline-mindmap.
- **Statistics Display**: Upon hovering over a phase, statistics related to that phase are shown, providing insights into various aspects such as positive, negative, and comments counts.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (React framework)
